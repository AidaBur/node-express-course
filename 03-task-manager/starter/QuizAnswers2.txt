The asyncWrapper was created to eliminate repetitive try-catch blocks and automatically pass errors to the error handler, 
making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {  
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;  
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });  
  if (!task) {  
    return next(new CustomAPIError(`Task with id: ${taskID} not found`, 404));  
  }  
  res.status(200).json({ task });  
});
